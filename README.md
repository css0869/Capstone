Safe Beauty Product Recommendation


An ingredient specific skincare recommendation system with allergy/irritation/sensitivities considerations, by examining labels.

Problem Statement

People with sensitive skin or weak immune systems may develop a reaction to certain substances in cosmetic products. The best way to avoid contact allergies is to know what you are sensitive to and stop using that ingredient. Some companies label their products as ‘’for sensitive skin’, ‘hypoallergenic’ or ‘skin-friendly’. However, per the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there is no federal standard on regulating the use of these terms (from FDA government website).  

And contact allergies can take years to surface, when once-loved beauty products need to be replaced with *safe* substitutes, with similar benefits, for example skin tightening, customers will have to compare labels line by line. This project builds a skincare recommendation system that incorporates allergy/irritation considerations. Can be a valuable resource for people having allergies and sensitivities to certain substances in beauty and skincare products.
